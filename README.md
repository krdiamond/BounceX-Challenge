### Challenge #2
Using the website marmot.com, write some JavaScript or jQuery code that can be run in the console of the browser on any product page.
The code should do the following:
- Store variables for product name, product price, and a 15% discounted price.
- Create a trigger that activates an overlay when the user clicks any size option.
- The overlay should be centered on top of the site and display the information gathered above along with two buttons - one button should close the overlay and the other should take the user to the cart page. The text in the overlay should read:
"Get this {product name} for {discounted price} with a 15% discount"
- Behind the overlay add a semiÂ­-transparent black background that obscures the site.
- The overlay should be able to trigger multiple times if dismissed.
